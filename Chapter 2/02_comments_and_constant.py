# In this code, we will cover comments and constants in python.
# Comments in programming are used to explain code, making code more readable and maintainable.
# In python, there are two types of comments: single-line comments and multi-line comments.
# Single-line comments start with a hash symbol (#) and continue abto the end of the line.
# Multi-line comments are enclose in triple quotes (''' or """) and can span multiple lines."

# example of singl-line comment
# This is a single-line comment in python
print("Hello, World!") # This single-line comment after a line of code.
# exzmple of multi-line comment
''' first line of multi-line comment
second line of multi-line comment'''

# Constants in python are variables that there values should not be changed after flow of the program.
# note in python constants are not enforced by the lannguage, to be unchanged, its just a convention to use them in UPPER_CASE.
PI = .3.141592 # This is a constant value for pi, it should not be changed.
# Constants are often used to store values that are used throughout the program, but should not be modified.
